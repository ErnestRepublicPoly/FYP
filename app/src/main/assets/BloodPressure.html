        <center><h1>Blood Pressure</h1>
           <br/>
           <p>Blood pressure refers to the force exerted by the body against the inner walls of the blood vessels particularly arteries. Your blood pressure doesnâ€™t stay constant throughout the day. It is the lowest when you are sleeping and rises when you are moving, excited, nervous or physically active..</p>
           <br/>
           <h3>Your blood pressure is recorded as two numbers:</h3>
           <br/>
           <h5>Systolic blood pressure (top number): indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery when the heart beats. It is the contraction of your heart muscles.</h5>
           <h5>Diastolic blood pressure (bottom number): indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls while the heart is resting between beats.  It is the relaxation of your heart muscles.</h5>
           <br/>
           <p>Both numbers are important in determining the state of your heart health. Numbers greater than ideal range indicate that your heart is working too hard to pump blood to the rest of your body. Monitoring your blood pressure is important because the higher your BP, the higher your risk of developing health problems in future. When blood pressure is high, it puts extra strain on your arteries and heart. This may lead to heart attack or stroke.</p>

           <p>Even if you have healthy numbers, you should take preventive measures to keep your blood pressure in the normal range. This can help you lower your risk of developing metabolic diseases</p>
           <br/>
           <h3>Here are some preventive measures to lower your blood pressure.</h3>
           <h4>1. Reduce your sodium intake</h4>
           <p>It is recommended for individuals to consume no more than 2000mg per day. Limit processed food and ask for no or less gravy.</p>
           <h4>2. Exercise</h4>
           <h4>3. Managing stress level</h4>
           <h4>4. Maintaining a healthy weight</h4>
           <p>Studies have found that if one is overweight, even losing 2kg can make an impact on blood pressure readings</p>
           <h4>5. Reducing alcohol intake and quit smoking</h4>
