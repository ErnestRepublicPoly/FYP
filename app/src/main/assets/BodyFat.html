           <h2>What causes excess body fat?</h2>
           <p>Energy / Calories: If you supply your body with more calories than it demand,
               those excess calories that are not burned by daily activity will be stored as fat cells.
               If this stored fat us nit converted to energy, it creates excess body fat. </p>
